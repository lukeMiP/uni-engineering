                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom"> Motivation.</h4>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom"> This project began after noticing the high price of standalone drum machines, synthesizers, and MIDI controllers on the market. While I understood that these devices involved complex design, I couldn’t justify the thousand-dollar-plus price tags. I wanted to see if I could create a more affordable, fully functional alternative myself.</p>
                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom"> Requirements.</h4>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">To solve this problem, the project had several key requirements: 
                                                        <br> <strong>Standalone operation</strong> – MIDI controllers designed to connect to a laptop DAW (digital audio workstation) are inexpensive and widely available, but they reduce portability and defeat the purpose of this project. My device needed to operate completely on its own.
                                                        <br> <strong>Cheaper and better</strong> – The build cost (excluding R&D time) had to be lower than commercial products, while still offering features and usability I considered superior.
                                                        <br> <strong>Velocity sensitivity</strong> – This was non-negotiable. High-quality MIDI controllers, synthesizers, and drum pads all measure how hard a note is played. To be a genuine alternative, my solution had to support velocity-sensitive input.</p>
                <h4 class="scroll-animated-from-bottom"> The Solution.</h4>
                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom"> I began by researching velocity-sensitive buttons and discovered a pressure-sensitive material made by 3M called <strong>Velostat</strong>. I came across a YouTube video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAtv-m32v8">link</a>) where the creator used Velostat sandwiched between copper tape layers, paired with a Teensy microcontroller to read pressure values and send MIDI data over USB. 
                                                        <br>My first prototype followed a similar design: Velostat with copper tape and a Raspberry Pi Pico to read pressure values and send MIDI over USB. The final version improved on this by integrating copper traces directly into a PCB, making the system more reliable and easier to assemble. 
                                                        <br>The next stage was software development. Initially, I prototyped using Python on a Raspberry Pi 4, reading raw pressure data and playing sounds when a press was detected. This worked, but Python’s performance limitations made real-time audio playback impractical. I tried again in C, but its limited audio-handling capabilities held me back. That’s when I discovered <strong>Pure Data (Pd)</strong>—a visual programming language designed specifically for audio. It runs natively on Raspberry Pi OS, works in real time, and includes built-in audio effects. This made it the perfect environment for the final product. However, since Pure Data cannot directly access GPIO pins, I wrote a C program that translates the pressure values into MIDI messages, which Pd can then read via an internal MIDI protocol. This setup made the system infinitely configurable. Adding new features only requires building a new Pd patch. (See some of my patches on the right!) 
                                                        <br>The hardware was kept deliberately simple: an acrylic top cover with TPU 3D-printed pads. This kept the cost down while still being durable and playable. The total cost of the project—including the Raspberry Pi—came to just over $200, a fraction of the cost of the alternatives.</p>
